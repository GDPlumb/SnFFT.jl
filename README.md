# SnFFT

Dependencies
------------
SnFFT is written in Julia, a a high-level, high-performance programming language designed for technical computing.  It can be downloaded here:

[Download Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/)

To analyze data on Sn, SnFFT does not depend on any external library.  The clustering example uses R's "sparcl" library to perform sparse hierarchical clustering.  This is the only external dependency and is used only for the clustering example.
